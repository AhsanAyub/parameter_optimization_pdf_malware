## Parameter Optimization for PDF Malware Dataset

****The pourpose of this analysis is to find how the result have been biased or impacted for different kinds of ML model from different ML families after perameter tuning.****
* We're used 20 different classifiers from different types of ML Family.
* We're used only Binary Classification.
* Dataset has been found from [there](https://github.com/srndic/mimicus/tree/master/data).
* After analysis, result has been published [there](https://github.com/AhsanAyub/parameter_optimization_pdf_malware/blob/master/malicious%20pdf%20classification%20results.pdf).
