## Parameter Optimization for PDF Malware Dataset

***The purpose of this analysis is to find how the results have been biased or impacted for different kinds of ML models from different ML families after being parameter tuning.***
* We're used 20 different classifiers from different types of ML Family.
* We're used only Binary Classification.
* Dataset has been found from [there](https://github.com/srndic/mimicus/tree/master/data).
* After analysis, the results have been published [there](https://github.com/AhsanAyub/parameter_optimization_pdf_malware/blob/master/malicious%20pdf%20classification%20results.pdf).
